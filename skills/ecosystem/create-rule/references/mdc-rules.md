# MDC rule format

Use only when the target runtime supports `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`. SKILL.md governs product selection and scope.

## Rule File Format

Rules are `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` with YAML frontmatter:

```
.cursor/rules/
  typescript-standards.mdc
  react-patterns.mdc
  api-conventions.mdc
```

### File Structure

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this rule does
globs: **/*.ts  # File pattern for file-specific rules
alwaysApply: false  # Set to true if rule should always apply
---

# Rule Title

Your rule content here...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | What the rule does (shown in rule picker) |
| `globs` | string | File pattern - rule applies when matching files are open |
| `alwaysApply` | boolean | If true, applies to every session |

---

## Rule Configurations

### Always Apply

For universal standards that should apply to every conversation:

```yaml
---
description: Core coding standards for the project
alwaysApply: true
---
```

### Apply to Specific Files

For rules that apply when working with certain file types:

```yaml
---
description: TypeScript conventions for this project
globs: **/*.ts
alwaysApply: false
---
```
