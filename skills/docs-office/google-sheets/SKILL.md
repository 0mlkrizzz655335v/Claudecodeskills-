# Google Sheets

Use this skill to keep spreadsheet work grounded in the exact spreadsheet, sheet, range, headers, and formulas that matter.

### Clarification

Use the request, conversation, and relevant sources to resolve the topic, audience, purpose, and material analytical definitions. Ask only when missing information would materially change the result and cannot reasonably be inferred; otherwise proceed. Do not invent missing source facts.

When clarification is useful, ask one concise group of questions using an available question tool or a message. Reuse answers and choices already provided. If an optional question receives no answer, proceed with a stated reasonable assumption; required authorization or indispensable source facts cannot be supplied by a timeout.

## Purpose Of This File

This file is intentionally minimal and only covers:

1. routing to the right spreadsheet workflow
2. stateful operation and mandatory routing to reference files
3. live-read/search safety for direct connector calls

Detailed editing, formula, chart, upload, live-read/search, and batch-update rules live in `references/`.
Read the references needed for the active operation and reuse guidance already loaded in the conversation while it remains current.
If the user has not provided explicit style direction, read `references/style-profiles.md` and apply the appropriate Google Sheets destination default before authoring workbook formatting.

## Default Routing

1. New Google Sheet from a native Google Sheets reference or template URL: copy the entire source workbook with the Drive file-copy action, then trim or repair the copy. Treat a deep-linked `gid` as the initial view, not copy scope. Duplicate one source sheet only when the user explicitly requests a single-sheet extraction. Do not rebuild through `.xlsx` when chips, validation, formulas, rich links, or formatting matter.
2. Other new Google Sheets creation: Inspect the available skills and plugins for the registered `Spreadsheets` capability. It may be exposed as the `$Spreadsheets` skill, the `@Spreadsheets` plugin, or the plugin URI `plugin://spreadsheets@openai-primary-runtime`. If found, load and follow its instructions.
   - If a system spreadsheet plugin or skill is installed, YOU MUST use it to create a local `.xlsx`. Then import the `.xlsx` into Drive as a native Google Sheets spreadsheet. For table-like option/list/dropdown columns, seed a valid row and add native table `DROPDOWN` columns post-import.
   - If neither skill is installed, create the spreadsheet directly with Google Sheets MCP.
3. Existing Google Sheets edits: use Google Sheets MCP directly.

Return the Google Spreadsheet link as the primary deliverable; include a local `.xlsx` only when the user also requested it.

## File Safety

Treat a provided Google Sheet as read-only unless the user explicitly asks to edit that file. When a task uses the Sheet as a reference, template, similar structure, or data source, copy it or create a separate Sheet, then verify the output spreadsheet ID differs before writing.

## Canonical Workflow Bias

Prefer one simple proven workflow over a large tree of recovery branches.
When a task matches a known successful pattern, follow that pattern directly instead of re-evaluating every possible fallback path.
Do not let accumulated edge-case guardrails turn a straightforward Sheets task into a long blocker-analysis exercise.

For sheet creation and editing tasks, prefer this sequence when viable:

1. Gather the required source material.
2. Pick the correct default routing.
3. Establish the sheet checklist or sheet plan.
4. Build or edit the sheet.
5. Verify the sheet is clean, complete, native, and scannable per `references/reference-visual-quality.md`.
6. Stop once the verified workflow has succeeded.

If a simple verified workflow is viable, use it. Do not drift into speculative alternate paths.

## Required Read Order (No Skips)

For every route that creates, imports, or edits a Google Sheet, read `references/reference-visual-quality.md` before final verification.

If Default Routing uses native Google Sheets reference-follow creation:
1. Read `references/reference-edit-workflow.md`
2. Read `references/reference-live-read-search-safety.md`
3. Read `references/reference-native-cell-structure.md`
4. Read `references/reference-batch-update-recipes.md`

If Default Routing uses the system spreadsheet plugin or skill like `[@spreadsheets](plugin://spreadsheets@openai-primary-runtime)` or `$Spreadsheets`:
1. Read the plugin/skill, e.g. `[@spreadsheets](plugin://spreadsheets@openai-primary-runtime)`
2. Read `references/reference-import-spreadsheet-to-native-sheets.md`
3. If the new Sheet has explicit or reference-derived option/list/dropdown columns, read `references/reference-batch-update-recipes.md` before the post-import table batch update.

If Default Routing uses connector edit workflow:

1. Read `references/reference-edit-workflow.md`.
2. Before any direct live range read, cell read, or `search_spreadsheet_rows`, read `references/reference-live-read-search-safety.md`.
3. Read every task-specific file from the matrix below.
4. If the task spans multiple categories, read all matching files.
5. If uncertain, use the task-to-reference map or search reference headings to identify the missing guidance. Do not read unrelated reference files.

Read the references required by the active route before content edits; reuse them across turns unless the route, runtime, or files changed.

## Final Answer Requirement

For net-new creation only, when Default Routing selects the registered `Spreadsheets` capability, create the local `.xlsx` and import it with `upload_mode: "native_google_sheets"`. Existing-sheet edits stay on the direct connector route and native-reference creation stays on the native-copy route; neither requires rebuilding a local `.xlsx`.
Return the verified Google Spreadsheet link. Include a local `.xlsx` only when the user also requested that local deliverable.

### Spreadsheets location

Use/create `ChatGPT` at My Drive root. Place new spreadsheets created from scratch or from a template there.
Edit existing spreadsheets in place.

Respect user-specified locations.

## Connector Load Checklist

1. Confirm the exact target Google Sheet URL or spreadsheet id before editing an existing spreadsheet.
2. If the user only gives a title or title keywords, use the connector/app search path to identify candidate spreadsheets before asking for a URL.
3. Resolve and record the spreadsheet id, target sheet names, and `sheetId` values.
4. Read spreadsheet metadata before deeper reads or writes.
5. For direct live range reads, cell reads, or `search_spreadsheet_rows`, use exact visible tab names from metadata, bounded ranges, and the recovery rules in `references/reference-live-read-search-safety.md`. Do not guess `Sheet1`, scan whole grids, or retry oversized row searches.
6. Before each edit pass, identify the exact sheet, range, headers, formulas, and validation constraints being edited through connector reads.
7. Re-read target cells before writing when live values, formulas, formatting, or validation could affect the write.
